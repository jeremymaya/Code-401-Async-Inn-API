## Description

This is a RESTful API server built using ASP.NET Core to allow Async Hotel mangement to better manage the assets in their hotels. This application can modify and manage rooms, amenities, and new hotel locations. The data entered by the user will persist across a relational database and maintain its integrity as changes are made to the system.

The Below is link to the MVC web application version of the assignment:

## Using Postgres Instead of SQL Server on Docker

Go to [ASP.NET Core Development with macOS](https://gist.github.com/jeremymaya/a36c1de8220d76beca85a2804a2cecc4) for more details.

If you have not already, download the [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac?tab=description).

1. Download Postgres with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker pull posgtres
    ```

2. Launch the Docker Image with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run --name psql -e POSTGRES_USER=sa -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ReallyStrongPassowrd1234! -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
    ```

3. Update the connection string with the following:

    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=DbName;Username=sa;Password=ReallyStrongPassword1234!"
    }
    ```

4. Add a dependency on ```Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL```
